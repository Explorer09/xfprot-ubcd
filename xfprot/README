INSTALLATION
	First of all get the Gtk+ libraries version 2.18.0 or superior
	(runtime and development) from www.gtk.org, if they are not already
	installed on your system.

INSTALLING XFPROT
	Download it at http://web.tiscali.it/sharp/xfprot and extract it:

	tar -zxvf xfprot-xx.tar.gz

	To compile xfprot ,cd to the xfprot source directory and just type:
		
		su root 
		(and provide root password if prompted)
		./configure
	
	or

		sudo ./configure
		(and provide your password if prompted)	

	The configure script accepts (among others) this command line options:
	
		--help                         help text, to see all available options
		--enable-debug                 enable debugging (default=no)
		--enable-sudo                  prefer use of sudo if available for updates
		--enable-su                    prefer use of su if availbale for updates
		--with-kdeprefix=PATH          prefix for KDE libraries for KDE3 desktop
		                               integration

	Then type:
	
		make

	If you don't receive any error message, you can install xfprot.

	PLEASE REMOVE ANY PREVIOUS INSTALLED VERSION OF XFPROT!!!.

	To install xfprot just type:

		make install
		or

	Please remove any previous installed version of xfprot.

	You can uninstall xfprot any time with:
		
		su root
		(and provide root password if prompted)
		make uninstall
	or

USAGE
	The GUI is self explanatory (.... I hope).
	On the commandline xfprot accepts this options;
	
	xfprot [option] [path]
		-k                       Run as KDE menu action
		-h                       display this help and exit
		-v                       output version information and exit

TRANSLATIONS
	If you want to translate the xfprot GUI to your language
	use the xfprot.pot file as a template, rename it to xx.po,
	add a copyright notice with your name and email,
